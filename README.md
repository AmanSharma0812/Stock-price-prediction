# Stock-price-prediction
Stock price prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks is a popular machine learning approach for forecasting future stock prices.
# LSTM
Certainly! LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. They are particularly useful for time series prediction tasks.
